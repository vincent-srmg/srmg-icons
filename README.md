# SVG Icon Component Library for React

This is a starter project for an SVG-based icon component library for React, built using [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

## Overview

Generate ready-made React components from `.svg` files using `@svgr/cli` and bundle them into a library using `rollup`. No need to write any React code yourself!
